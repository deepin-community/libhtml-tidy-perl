libhtml-tidy-perl (1.60-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Tighten build dependency on libtidy-dev again to 2:5.6.0-9.
    The -8 added a patch which conflicted with our patch, which is dropped in
    -9 again.

libhtml-tidy-perl (1.60-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Update debian/patches/tests-tidy-html5-5.6.patch.
    Debian's tidy-html5 2:5.6.0-7 contains cherry-picked upstream commits
    which change the output again. This needs a small tweak in t/opt-00.t.
    Thanks to Paul Gevers for noticing the failure on ci.debian.net.
  * Tighten versioned build dependency on libtidy-dev.

libhtml-tidy-perl (1.56-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  * Update Vcs-Browser URL to cgit web frontend

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * d/p/fix-error-message-in-webtidy: move to end of patch series.
    This is a firmly Debian-specific change that is not suitable for
    upstream.
  * d/patches: put all patches in the git style allowed by DEP-3,
    so they can be manipulated with gbp-pq
  * d/p/lib-ignore-tidy-html5-s-differently-formatted-summar.patch,
    d/p/t-allow-tidy-html5-as-generator.patch,
    d/p/t-don-t-assert-that-tidy-will-add-a-HTML-3.2-doctype.patch,
    d/p/t-unicode.t-don-t-assert-that-the-DOCTYPE-is-preserv.patch,
    d/p/t-use-a-pre-HTML5-DOCTYPE-to-get-warnings-about-unes.patch,
    d/p/t-venus.t-adjust-expected-result-for-tidy-html5.patch:
    add patches to make the tests pass with tidy-html5 providing libtidy
    (Closes: #829409)
  * d/p/tidy-not-tidyp.patch: alter to support either tidyp or
    tidy-html5, reinstating the (now somewhat misleadingly named)
    _tidyp_version function by using tidy-html5's tidyLibraryVersion().
    This is hopefully more palatable to upstream.
    - d/p/remove-tidy_version.patch: drop

  [ gregor herrmann ]
  * Set bindnow linker flag in debian/rules.
  * Mark package as autopkgtest-able.
  * Drop versioned Test::More build dependency.
    Already satisfied in oldstable.
